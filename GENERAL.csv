By popular request this Discord Community has been created for everyone to share ideas, contribute, ask questions, and bask in the awesomeness that is the maker community.
I released the OG solder reflow plate design (sw 1.0, hw 2.4) on GitHub (https://github.com/AfterEarthLTD/Solder-Reflow-Plate) and had it featured on an episode of GreatScott!'s DIY or BUY series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QarizoUnRfk&t=1s).
Since then the community response has been fantastic!
Lets carry on and build the new future!!!!","",""

- Current rating: should be high enough for the heating current
- Voltage rating: should be high enough for the input voltage (max 20V), plus some buffer (25V in total)
- Rds(on): Should be as low as possible, as the MOSFET resistance forms a voltage divider with the resistance of the heating bed, so the heat in the MOSFET is directly proportional to the heating power of the device
- Gate charge: should be as low as possible, but not that relevant, as you could lower the PWM frequency - mostly affects heat in the MOSFET

the heatbed has two main properties:
- internal resistance: should be neither too high, nor too low. too low also causes more heat in the MOSFET, if power output is constant
- necessary power output: the larger the heatpad, the more power you need. with constant voltage, the important factor is current, which is also heating up the MOSFET via the Rds(on).

as I see it, an overspecced MOSFET should be usable for all sizes of heatbeds, as long as it is in its current and voltage range, and Rds(on) is low enough","",""

The internal resistance of the MOSFET depends on the accumulated charge stored in the gate pin of the MOSFET.
When the gate is fully charged, the MOSFET is either fully blocking or fully conducting (depending on NMOS or PMOS).
Problematic are the phases inbetween: While the charge is pumped into or out of the gate pin, the internal resistance is some higher value than Rds(on), and with the current flowing through the MOSFET, this heats up the MOSFET more than necessary.
That's why you want the current (and thus charge) flowing in and out if the gate as high as possible: to keep the inbetween-staes of the MOSFET as short as possible, to reduce heat.
That's what a gate driver does: he provides a sufficiently high voltage and current for the gate.
A MCU is not able to provide these currents and votlages, but a simple 74xx logic gate (dual inverter or something like that) should do the job for this use case.","",""

**Mechanical Design**
- modular design
- main PCB: 100mm x 29mm
- replaceable heat PCB with few cheap parts
- XT60 for power connection (overpowered but available at LCSC)
- PCB is further stabilized by the inductor and the DC jack on the back
- thermal sensor is thermally coupled to the heat bed with a fuse holder and thermal paste/pad
**Power Input**
- DC barrel jack with plug detection
- USB C (footprint needs to be changed to power only USB-C) with IP2721 (currently not available at LCSC)
- supports input voltages from 12V to 20V
- high power diodes for polarity protection
- LM2940 LDO for 5V, as 78L05 does not tolerate reverse polarity (plugging in USB for programming could damage a 78L05)
**MCU**
- ESP32 DEVKITV1 board with all necessary peripherals
- wireless functions not yet needed
- 12bit ADC
- 8bit DAC
- cheap and easy to obtain, even during the chip crisis","","üòç (1)"
"479311458245672960","derspatz","2022-03-11T21:44:54.6040000+01:00","**Power Output**
- TPS55340 boost converter
- output voltage controllable with the MCU's DAC (by injecting voltage into the feedback pin)
- output voltage from 15V to 30V
- output current up to 5A
- more granular control over the output power, can be adjusted for different input supplies and heatbeds
- no high frequency PWM control (enable pin needs 1ms to trigger)
- flyback diode to prevent voltage spikes on the output
**Power Control**
- measures input voltage, output voltage, output current and temperature
- can obtain very exact information about power consumption etc.
- temp sensor has an opamp for more ADC resolution
**User Interface**
- 128x32 OLED
- +/- buttons
- 3 LEDs: POWER, HEATING, HOT (above 40¬∞C)
**Misc**
- nearly all parts available at LCSC (IP2721 listed but sold out, ESP32 and OLED need to be bought elsewhere)
- easy to solder, min part size is 0805, no QFN parts etc.
- Board and schematic are not fully done, some small things are missing","","üòç (1)"

See, the calculated resistance for the heating trace in the current PCB is 0.7 Ohms (1.4mm wide, 35¬µm thick, 206 cm long, https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/trace-resistance-calculator/) at 20¬∞C.
At 12 Volts, this results in a power consumption for the heating bed of 205W (17.1A!). At 200¬∞C, the resistance has nearly doubled to 1.2 Ohms, which results in a power output of 120W (10A). As you can see, the output power is only half as much on operating temperature. If we could ramp up the output voltage, we could keep the output power steady.
But this is not my main concern, ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è **my main concern is safety**: ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è  17A is nearly 3.5 times higher than what the power supply can deliver, and what the DC plug is specified for.

Maybe PSU and plug could even be run with higher power for a very short time if the heat plate reaches a safe resistance fast enough, but you could not guarantee that, maybe someone places something very large on the heat plate which would slow the heating process (like use it as a cup warmer for fun).
So, we have to raise the cold resistance of the heat bed to a level that is safe to run for extended periods of time. At 2.6 Ohms we have an output power of 55W (4.6A), but at 200¬∞C that would drop to 32W (2.7A).

Plus, by measuring and knowing the resistance and voltage, we can calculate the heatbed resistance, and by comparing the resistance at 20¬∞C and when hot, we can easily calculate the temperature of the actual heatbed. Electronic cigarettes in temperature control mode work like this.

Here's what I've changed (I tried to keep as much as possible from the original design:
- made the board larger (100x100mm)
- made the heat plate larger (83 x 68 mm)
- added a  resetable fuse
- added a lot of filtering capacitors
- adjusted the voltage divider for a lower Vref, this gives more ADC resolution for the analog temperature probe
- added the option to run analog or digital temperature probe, or both
- changed the capacitors for the LDO to electrolytic caps, as the AMS1117 might be unstable with ceramic caps
- added I2C pullup resistors, might not be needed, but this way you can add them if necessary
- moved some pins around for easier routing
- changed the switches from pull down to pull up
- added a simple NPN driver for the MOSFET
- added a flyback diode to reduce voltage spikes when switching the inductive load (heat plate)
- added some very important information for firmware to the schematic
- reduced the number of different resistors/capacitors on the BOM
- increased the heat plate resistance to a safer level
- switched some parts to parts that are easier to hand solder or easier available
- new routing with better grounding, only small interruptions in the ground layer, higher current capacity
- added a copper pour on the bottom layer under the heatbed, for better heat distribution
- this copper pour can be connected to ground close to the temp sensors, this might help with temp readings, but might impact EMI, even though I can't tell whether this will be positively or negatively

A simulation of the power consumption can be found here.

this would allow us to have different input voltages and be less strict about the heat plate resistance, as long as it can be driven well by the dc-dc converter.
less complicated is the solution with pwm. but with this solution, to have a safe device, we need to adjust the heat plate resistance so that the hot head bed will not overload the power supply at full PWM duty cycle (worst case, software error etc.; the heat plate gets hot and stays hot, but the psu can handle it). for the colder heat plate, the current consumption can be controlled by pwm. this also has the disadvantage that we need a lot of capacitors to filter out the current spikes for the PSU.
by measuring the input voltage and current, we can also calculate the actual heat plate temperature via the resistance change.
the original design has neither large enough input capacitors nor a heat plate resistance that is high enough to be considered safe. it just draws pulses of very high current directly from the PSU.","",""

My you have been a busy lot!
Apologies for my absence the past month or two. I've been really focussed on getting my last year of University completed and so have had little time to think of the SRP project.

I can see lots of fork designs have been made which is great. The Spatz version is great and does indeed include many more safety features than my original!
There are also a couple of designs with difference microcontrollers about which is awesome.

An update on my order of Ver3.0s with the ATmega4809......
I'm having trouble getting the final boards out of China. They have been short on workers due to covid and parts (despite it all being in stock when I ordered it).
I will continue to chase.
In the meantime, some of you have the Ver3.0 boards ready. Are you all still waiting for software?
If so, is anyone available to help with this? I can do the software side but I need someone with the finished Ver3.0 boards to test the software.

There are a lot of issues and pull requests on the Github. Apologies if you have been waiting for my response on these.
I'll crack on with them over the next few days. 

In the meantime, well done everyone!
Keep making!!!!","","üëã (6)"

I can turn  the heater on (BTW, I guess the chopping frequency is pretty audible!). However, If I unplug the device and reconnect it, the LCD is dead. I've checked that the voltages are ok (5v and the voltage divider is around 2.89V). Do you happen to know what it could be? Maybe de uCPU fuses??  Is the Reset line configured as GPIO?

- an Arduino Nano clone (Arduino Micro clone also available) with USB cable
- three wires
- a 4.7kOhm resistor
Can someone please run me through the firmware flashing process?
As I've always said, I'm more of a hardware guy... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","",""

2. Open jtag2updi/jtag2updi.ino in your Arduino IDE
3. Configure the flasher options for your Arduino Nano and flash it
4. Connect D6 of your Arduino Nano over the 4.7kOhm resistor to the UPDI pin of the board and 5V to 5V and GND to 0V
5. Add the MegaCoreX hardware package to the Ardunio IDE (see https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX#how-to-install)
6. Install the Adafruit_GFX, Adafruit_SSD1306 and Debounce2 libraries with the Library Manager (you might not need all of them depending on which firmware you plan to use)
7. Download and open the ino you want to upload to the ATMEGA4809 (I used this one: https://github.com/vonryan123/Solder-Reflow-Plate/blob/main/Board%20Versions/70mm%20by%2050mm%20Ver3.0%20ATmega4809/Software/SW1.0_HW3.0_70by50mm.ino)
8. Select the options in the screenshot (not sure about BOD and Clock, it worked for me tho) and select the port of your Ardunio Nano as Port
9. Select Burn Bootloader and see if it runs through
10. Temporarily disable auto reset for the Arduino Nano: https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DisablingAutoResetOnSerialConnection/ (not sure if it's needed for the Nano, it was for my Mega)

It's only a sample of 5 boards from each fab, so the difference is likely well within the margin of error. PCBWay's board had a slightly higher resistance, which seems to correspond to a copper thickness of roughly 29.1 microns. JLCPCB's boards seems to correspond to a copper thickness of 29.9 microns.

The one reason I did try ordering some boards from PCBWay is that there standard FR4 material has a higher glass transition temperature.

Most of my testing thus far has been on the design of the hotplate itself, focusing on how to design a hotplate for more even heat distribution, solder profiles, safety, hotplate durability and how best to measure temperature. There ar e a lot of caveats. The good news is that some of my most recent results suggest that with a suitable board, PCB hotplates may be more capable than I first thought and maybe even capable of handling SAC305 and similar lead free alloys.

It's possibly some component of the silkscreen material burning away. From about 200 celsius and up, you start to see smoking of the solder mask materials and above about 220-230 celsius you will probably see delamination (ie bubbling) of the solder mask material in the hotter parts of the board. On the PCBWay board I tested, all of these phenomena started at temperatures about 80-100 celsius higher.

I don't have great numbers, but from some of my testing, that looks to be somewhere in the 5-10 celsius range, but I'm less confident in those numbers. Mounting a sensor here gets tricky because at reflow temperatures, you'll almost certainly melt the solder securing it to the board unless you're using a much higher temperature alloy. Something like Pb95/Sn5 might do it.

Or, more likely, the peak reflow temp.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/949124076142751777/999598958504595478/unknown.png?ex=66598f13&is=66583d93&hm=c94f465fd378cec244e91de325fbcd8652de58dda04e7edc438fd556371e0357&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/949124076142751777/999598958856900638/unknown.png?ex=66598f13&is=66583d93&hm=eeeadfb2823d1676d7c5649ac844b77f3f8d1f84b75a2333671fea36e1c14b15&",""

I'm assuming they're similar. We had to do some fixes to get v3.0 working. I don't think Chris had had a chance to test it. I'm assuming the basic algorithms are similar, though. The firmware as provided seems kinda ok for low temperature solders (eg. SnBi), but like you I had to provide higher temperature options to get SnPb solder to reflow and getting SnPb to reflow does seem to push JLCPCB hotplate boards to their limits and perhaps beyond. That said, there are a number of flaws in that design - not just the firmware but in the electronics as well. With a suitable power supply it can be made to work, but things like the low PWM frequency and limited capacitance mean it will burden your power supply more than intended. There were also criticisms of it's lack of safety features. There is a better design by Spatz and others. There should be links to it further up in the chat. You may want to take a look at that.","",""

If I recall correctly, it just set's the duty cycle at a set amount and waits until the temperature sensor reports the set temperature, then it turns off. PID control would be ideal, but possibly overkill. One of my early design goals in improving this design was to build something that could reasonably follow a proper reflow profile, but give what I know now, it's more of a nice to have rather than a required feature. There was some talk about accuracy above... Realistically, it doesn't need to be that accurate. It just needs to get the board, solder paste and components hot enough to melt the solder and form good joints. It's a hobbyist device, not something suitable for cranking out thousands of boards a day. Some degree of temperature control is required to do this well, but it doesn't have to be terribly accurate. It doesn't have to get there in the time required by most reflow profiles - you'll generally need higher power to achieve the specified gradient. You'll also find that where you measure temperature matters a *LOT*. The temperature you really care about is on top of the board being reflowed, and that will be an estimate at best.","","üëç (1)"

This is a major overhaul of my first design, the main principle is the same, but almost everything was changed under the hood:
- new MCU that is cheap and available (STM32G030)
- USB C and barrel plug input (12-24V)
- replacable heat beds (different sizes and different voltages)
- table design with interlocked PCBs
- dual current measurement (one for monitoring the filtered input current, one for monitoring the unfiltered output current for resistance measurements)
- heat bed temperature is calculated by heat bed resistance
- sufficient capacitors with inrush current limiter
- dedicated gate driver
- analog temp sensor on the underside of the heat bed
- OLED display
- dual color LED
- three buttons (less hassle)
- proximity sensor under the heat bed, for easier automation of soldering process
- acoustic alarm
- cable connector to power fan table","","üî• (12)"

Noticed https://github.com/AfterEarthLTD/Solder-Reflow-Plate hasn't been updated in a while, but am seeing a bunch of forks actively being progressed.

Planning to place a small jlcpcb order soon.  Would be funny to include an order for this hotplate project as part of that order, to help me assemble my own project.

Curious if there's a ESP8266/ESP32 (or some Wifi capable) version of this project with the hot plate portion separate from the controller parts.  Seems like the hot plate portion will atrophy faster than the controller.  Would be nice to decouple controller from hotplate (use Alu?).  Would help with replacing/iterating hotplate board design faster, help controller longevity if only the hot plate (and thermistor) is housed.  Entire hotplate could be 100mm x 100mm while taking advantage of jlcpcb's cheap pricing.  Alternative/forked hotplate designs could be swapped out and used.  Expect heavy gauge wiring and connectors between controller and hotplate boards.

Anyway, I know nothing, and just joined.  Look forward to learning how the  community has progressed this project, and will try to help.

There is some discussion further back in the channel history, but the main points are that PCBWay boards are better suited to the thermal cycling than JLCPCB. JLCPCB boards show deterioration of the silk screen and solder mask well below 200 celsius and above 200 celsius, expect lots of smoke. PCBWay boards typically show the similar signs at about 80-100 celsius higher temperatures than JLCPCB.

Nothing? Bad idea. Copper oxidizes. This is slow at room temperature, but happens faster at elevated temperatures. You'll may shorten the life of the heating element or change it's operational characteristics over time. That may happen anyway, but I'd rather slow that as much as possible.

HASL? This is a solder coating. On a heating element designed to melt solder. You could end up with your reflowed board stuck to the hotplate.

ENIG? Why pay the higher cost for what might be a wear item anyway? We don't know how well PCB hotplates stand up over time anyway. Why pay ten or more times the price for ENIG when you can get something else for like $2 for 5 hotplates?

Any metal finish, including ENIG and HASL? You also run the risk of pads or other metal elements on your reflowed board shorting tracks in you heating element. This will give you hot spots and cold spots and could risk burning out portions of the heating element.

Standard $2 for 5 prototype boards from PCBWay work pretty well and withstand temperatures for standard 63/37 Sn/Pb solder quite well. Even lead free alloys like SAC305 might be ok, although that is pushing close to the limits from my testing, although I don't really work with lead free solder, so your mileage may vary. JLCPCB boards are less resistant to high temperature, but if you're willing to limit yourself to lower temperature SnBi alloys that melt around 140 celsius, you can probably get pretty good mileage from those as well. Those are the only two fabs I've used. There may be other manufacturers who have similar or better results with their materials.","","üëçüèº (1)"

The Temp sensor thats on there is too far away and doesn't really work if you dont know the Delta between actual temp and compensate for it in software. My hotplate for example gets stuck at around 80C (when trying to reach for 90C, which is the first stop in the temperature curve) because its not compensated for in software, so it never finishes the temp-curve. 
According to my little temperature monitoring circuit the hotplate reaches 130C when the Onboard sensor senses 70C, the Delta gets larger over time and therefore the onboard sensor is very inaccurate

After two to three minutes my circuit reaches about 145C and hovers there, which i assume is the maximum temperature the heatplate can achieve at 12V5A, but I wouldn't count on the exact value since my circuit (thermistor) is only capable of showing about 150C. 
This is enough for for my solderpaste, which requires around 130C. Another thing to keep in mind is that the copper underneath the soldermask is probably still significantly hotter - like 160-180C. So that is that.  

I think my method of monitoring is superior to the onboard sensor is  but not necessary to reflow your boards if you just cancel the process manually once your solder flowed","",""

I think I can only reliably read the registers and write an update to the power supply about once every 1.5 seconds. So my current code uses some estimates of the properties of the system like the thermal resistance to ambient of the hotplate and it's heat capacity. It then looks at the current temperature and the temperature it needs to get to by the next sample time and how much power it should need to get there and just commands that amount of power. It's not exactly open loop as there is some feedback going on, but it's not exactly adapting to changing conditions like a PID system might, either. As a technique that works remarkably well - far better than you really need. For hobby purposes, you're probably going to be just as well off with assuming that you need X watts/amps/volts for reflow and setting your power supply to do that for a few minutes until you see the components have all reflowed.","",""

I can reliably reflow SnPb solders and if I order my hotplates from PCBWay, they seem to deal with the heat ok. It comes down to how picky we want/need to be. For hobby use, the difference between 95% yields and 99.999% yields doesn't matter that much and a much more primitive approach with these boards like the aforementioned constant power and watch it reflow approach is probably going to exceed most people's expectations.","",""

It is a model railway locomotive wireless DCC controller - it allows me to use either a standard RC Tx and Rx OR my own design nRF24 based controller as control input, then 'build' a DCC signal. This signal is fed to a motor board which in turn drives the DCC decoder. 

Reason for two MCU's - my coding knowledge is basic, so I am using some available code (DCC++EX) running on one MCU. The creation of DCC signals is very timing critical, so running other software on that MCU requires specific libraries + interrupt setups. 

To make things easy, I run my code on the other MCU, and then send serial commands to the other (this is an availbe feature of DCC++EX). 

The many connectors are for Servos, smoke unit connection, and then a few extra incase I have a new idea and want an output.","","üëç (4),‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

There are some reasons you might consider a spiral layout for the heating element, but I prefer a bifilar layout. The spiral design will increase the inductance of the heating element. I guess that could be desirable depending on how you intend to drive it, but it also creates a problem with how you get the power to the centre of the element. It can be done, but then you need vias or something which introduce new elements to complicate things and/or fail over multiple heat/cool cycles. The bifilar layout gives you the symmetry advantages you might get from a spiral layout but it gets both ends of the heating element to the outside making power connection trivial and the magnetic field mostly cancel out reducing the parasitic inductance of the heating element.","",""

"976277823272665169","brettski74","2023-01-26T09:34:37.8850000+01:00","Start with how much power you need the hotplate to output. This will be dependent on how large your hotplate is, what temperature you want to be able to reach and how fast.

For max temperature, use about 30 celsius above the melting/liquidus temperature of the solder alloy you want to reflow, so about 170 celsius for SnBi or 210 for SnPb.

For your hotplate size, start with your desired dimensions, do the calculations and if the power requirement is too high, then adjust. My current design has a heating element that is 85mm x 88mm, which fits nicely on a 100mmx100mm board with some space at the edges to allow for mounting, power connection and some spaces for recording parameters like the hotplate resistance at 20 celsius. For my 85x88 mm board, the area is 7480 square mm.

To get an estimate of how much power you need, take the area of your heating element in square mm and multiply it by 0.00032. This will give you an estimate of the thermal resistance to ambient air of your hotplate in K/W. For my example 7480 square mm board, this gives me a thermal resistance of about 2.4 K/W.

Subtract typical ambient temperature (eg 25 celsius) from your maximum temperature to give yourself a temperature delta in Kelvin. Assuming low temperature SnBi solder, I get 170 - 25 = 145 K.

Take that temperature delta and divide it by the thermal resistance you estimated above - 145 / 2.4 = 60.4W. This is the absolute minimum power you'd need to hold the hotplate at 145 Kelvin above the ambient air. In reality, you'll need more than this if you hope to get to your target temperature in a reasonable amount of time. From my experience, adding an additional 30% is a good lower limit that will let you follow a reflow profile reasonably well, so 60.4 x 1.3 = 78.5W. So you probably want about 80W of power. If your power supply can provide that, then happy days. If not, adjust something and try again.","",""

I'd err on the side of keeping current lower and maximizing voltage, but also keep in mind that the heating element resistance may be something like 50% higher at reflow temperatures than it is a room temperature. I'd check that you can meet your power requirements at both temperatures for best results, otherwise you may struggle to keep up as the heating element gets warmer.","",""

Mechanical connections are a better idea IMHO. You already are using screws and stand-offs in your mounting solution. Leverage those. I use ring connectors and have large pads around my M3 screws to provide connection to the board. That avoids the challenge of soldering those wires on and any concerns about them coming off under heat. That should also allow you to get rid of the long air-gapped piece that seems to serve no purpose except for isolating the power connections from the heat. Use silicone insulated wire for your power connections and you should be fine.","",""

For most purposes, any of the commonly used alloys will work fine and you probably won't notice a difference. I personally prefer SnPb solder, because it's the alloy that we have the most experience with, it has good wetting characteristics, good mechanical properties and reasonably good conductivity. Also, if you get the eutectic alloy (63/37), it has a single, actual freezing point rather than a liquidus/solidus temperature range and this makes it easier to get good joints when hand soldering. I tend to avoid SAC alloys because of the higher temperature and the liquidus/solidus temperature range means that you end up with poor joints if there's much movement while it's freezing. I have some SnBi solder paste, but I rarely use it because the conductivity is lower, the joints are more brittle and if you use the cheapest finish on your boards (HASL with leaded solder) you risk forming SnBiPb intermetallics in the joint which may have liquidus temperatures below 100 celsius. That said, for most purposes you probably won't notice much difference and I'm probably overthinking it.","","üëç (3)"

1. Your stuff will just arrive and you don't have to worry about anything either because the amount is too small or the seller arranged to pay customs and/or tax  for you on your behalf.###
2. The carrier will take care of the customs stuff and will then collect customs fees, taxes and brokerage fees from you when they deliver your stuff. +++
3. Your stuff will get held at a post office or depot of some sort and you'll get a notice telling you to come and pick it up after paying customs fees, faxes and brokerage fees. +++

### Technically, things like sales tax, GST and VAT are often the responsibility of the buyer to pay but when the amounts are so small, the labour spent in collecting and account for it costs more than the amount collected, so for small purchases you're likely to just have your stuff let straight through.
+++ Carriers like Fedex, DHL and UPS typically have options to allow you to pay the fees owed up front via their website. You can often find out how to do this via the tracking function on their website although some are better at this than others. Fedex could learn a thing or two from DHL in this respect.","",""

The v2.4 and v3.0 designs have insufficient input capacitance to buffer the load of the heating element at the rather low PWM frequency that the stock firmware uses. Changing the register settings to use a higher PWM frequency would help a little. The max you can get is about 63kHz but even at that much higher frequency, 100uF of input capacitance is far too low for the load. If you make a few assumptions like trying to limit the input current to about 7.5A average and 10A peak, then you still need somewhere around 1320uF of input capacitance. The @derspatz design uses roughly double that. Check out my fork. I've forked the vonryan fork which had some of the v3.0 fixes plus a few more v3.0 fixes of my own and also updated the documentation both for accurate v3.0 build information as well as some of the issues with the design as is.

```# **Solder Reflow Plate - 70mm by 50mm Ver 3.0 ATmega4809**

## How-To - Programming the Board
This Solder Reflow Plate has been specifically designed to be Arduino based and easily programmed through the Arduino IDE or any other similar environment.
For ease, here is a guide to programming the board via the Arduino IDE.
The ATmega4809 is UPDI programmed. Once the boards arrive and I have experienced this myself I will write up a full guide. In the meantime there are a few good guides out there on UPDI programming from an Arduino.

### Preparation

One issue is that you need to account for the resistance of the leads. That can be enough to throw the temperature calculation off by a fairly large margin, but maybe the lead resistance is inaccurate, or maybe the leads are warming up enough that it's throwing off the calculations.

You just set up a voltage divider across a known reference voltage with the thermistor on one side and then read the voltage with an ADC. The datasheet contain tabulated data for temperatures from -40 to 300 celsius, although for most purposes, you can use a two-point linear approximation unless you need stupid levels of accuracy/linearity. The challenge as always is where to mount the sensor to get good thermal contact with a relevant part of the hotplate. I only used these as a calibration check for my resistance based temperature measurements. Ultimately, accurate temperature measurement in this context is poorly defined at best and not really necessary, anyway.

My thinking is that somewhere closer to the edge, although not right on the edge is better. Your temperature will be highest in the centre of your hotplate unless you have made design modifications to address this. With that in mind, you want to make sure that the entire board being reflowed reaches reflow temperatures for at least a few seconds to ensure good solder joints are formed. You're unlikely to damage anything if you hit 250 celsius, but if you only hit 175 celsius (assuming SnPb solder), then you have a problem because those areas won't reflow. Therefore, you want to be measuring temperatures on the lower end of what your hotplate is doing and aiming for around 20-30 celsius above the melting/liquidus temperature of your solder alloy to ensure good repeatable results. I would suggest mounting the sensor in a corner, around 10-15 mm in from the edge of the heating element. If you're hitting good reflow temperatures there, you should be pretty good across the entire hotplate.","",""

Sometimes you'll see B25/85 or B25/100 published instead, but B25/50 seems most common. The thing is, the further you get from those two temperatures, the less accurate you get. As an example, for an Eaton NRBG104?3950B1* thermistor, if you use the published B25/50 value of 3950K, then you'll be off by about 8 degrees by 200 celsius - ie. when your measurement tells you it's 200 celsius, it'll actually be closer to 192 celsius. If you have the full tabulated resistance data, you can calculate a more appropriate beta value to use. For example, B25/200 for the same thermistor is about 4079K.

I have posted several graphs. That was from my own software that controls a bare hotplate PCB from a DPS-5020 power supply using Modbus control over USB. I have perl scripts that handle the Modbus comms to sense voltage & current, calculate temperature and then update the power supply output to follow the reflow profile.

Next best option is to take the known resistance at two temperatures - preferably near the upper and lower ends of the temperature range you care about most - and use that to calculate a beta value and then use the Steinhart-Hart equation to calculate temperature from the resistance.

For best accuracy, I'd suggest giving the sensors plenty of time to soak and reach a stable value before recording any measurements. One temperature should be room temperature, since it's pretty easy to get that measured from a steady state. For the upper temperature, maybe you can use a hot air stations to set a constant temperature. That'll be a lot faster to get to steady state. Alternatively, maybe tape the two sensors down to a hotplate and run it at a constant power until you see steady state - something like no increase in 60 seconds is probably close enough to steady state to take a measurement.

What's important is that you don't heat or cool too quickly so that you don't thermally stress components and damage them. If you take a brittle component and make one part of it significantly hotter than another, the expansion/contraction may crack the part. Cooling down more slowly than specified is generally fine. I'm also curious about the flat section in the middle. That would be your soak stage. You generally want soak to end just around the melting point of your solder alloy and you want it to be long enough to get everything - board, components, flux and solder - to be right around the melting point so that when you ramp up the temp in the reflow stage, everything is on the verge of reflowing and forms good solder joints. I'm assuming this is for SnPb solder. I would suggest your soak stage should ramp up slowly to about 180 celsius over a period of about 120 seconds. If you don't soak long enough, you may have unreliable results around larger components that take longer to heat up.","","üëç (1)"

The second graph, the orange line, is following the target quite nicely, though I'd wish it would come up to the soldering temperature (highest temp) a bit quicker, but for that I guess I'd hae to get a stronger power supply than 12V 5A. Or maybe it is just a matter of adjusting the integral constant. I'll have a try soon. Also I removed bits form the code that seemed to wait for the temp to get within a threshold before going to the next step in the profile. If the PID is well tuned, it shouldn't be needed. Also, in each next step, the start temp was set to current temp, I don't know that it was there, but I changed the code for the target temperature (cuirrent set value) to follow the profile instead of relying on values from current temp.

As a general rule of thumb, I would suggest you want around 1.2-1.5W per square centimetre of hotplate area in order to have plenty of power available to stay with the more aggressive stages of a reflow profile. The AfterEarthDesigns boards have a hotplate area of about 35 square centimetres, so for something that size, you want to be able to pump somewhere around 45-50W into the board to be confident of staying with your reflow profile. If your heating element is larger than that, then scale those numbers up to about 1.2-1.5W per square centimetre. Whether 12V 5A is enough to do that will depend on your heating element resistance and your maximum duty cycle that you allow in the firmware. If you're already able to pump that much power into your heating element, then it may well be software or PID tuning hold you back, as you alluded to.","",""

From memory, I think changing the emissivity setting in my thermal imageer between 1.0 and 0.7 didn't change the temperature readings by that much, but I can't say I've played with or tested that extensively. I might be wrong. Do some testing with some different targets and see what the results look like. Use one or more other sensors as a point of comparison. I've used K-type thermocouples with my multimeter, kitchen thermometers and sensor rigs I've built with NTC thermistors. That was probably overkill, although it did give me an appreciation of how temperature can vary between locations. If you can show the results are reasonably consistent when a more trusted sensor is also consistent, you should be able to work with that. Like I said, precision is more important here than accuracy. It would be nice if the board was actually at 200 celsius when you sensor says it is, but so long as it's at roughly the same temperature any time it says 200 celsius, then you can make it work, even if that temperature happens to be 150 or 250 celsius or whatever.","",""

I'm designing my own hot plate and I had a few questions concerning the desired resistance of hot plate. My hot plate only has to heat up to like 50 degrees so I guess that the resistance isn't that important cause I can always just limit the power through software, but I tried to calculate it either way, I even made my own Kicad Plugin to Calculate it for me! And the results are very similar to your hot plate designs, my design has a trace width of 1 mm, a height of 35 ¬µm and a length of approx. 3 m, so this results in a hotplate resistance of approx. 1.5 Ohm. Which is a bit high for the power supply I am using right now ( 12 V, 5A max) but it'll still manage because of the relatively low temperatures. 

The thing that I don't understand is how it is possible for heatbed's of 3D printers to have a similar resistance?! Their traces are way way longer (the one used on the Prusa 3D printers is more than 30m!) while only a tiny bid wider, so the resistance should be way higher as well then right? Or am I missing something? 

Some advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated!","",""

When you say 50 degrees, is that the temperature you want to reach, or is that the delta about ambient temperature (ie. you want to hit about 75 celsius, which is about 50 degrees above ambient)?

For a hotplate that fits within the 100x100mm limit of the cheap PCB manufacturing options with about 7mm margin on all sides for mounting hardware would only need about 10W to maintain that kind of temperature difference. If you want to be able to get there quicker, you might increase the power requirement to something like 15W. Any more than that would seem like overkill for something of that size. For something like a 215x215mm area like a Prusa heat bed. That's designed to operate on about 130W to get it comfortably up to around 100 celsius - around a 75 kelvin delta - roughly 3 times your needs, but with only about 40% more power than you're currently planning. For something around that size, I expect you probably are looking at something like 40-50W, depending on how fast you want to be able to get there. This also seems to track reasonably well with my data - about 4 times the area should need about 4 times the power for the same temperature delta. It will be less than linear because as you get larger there are limits to how easily it can bleed off heat into the environment - smaller hotplates lose heat more easily.

It really just comes down to tweaking track width and track pitch until you get what you're looking for. Even then, the numbers that come out in CAD aren't always the same as the numbers you get after it's manufactured. Interesting things happen at corners, so more corners might make your simple model of track resistance less accurate. What I generally do is that I try to keep the gap between the track constant while I reduce track width, That generally gets you a slowly increasing resistance as the track gets narrower and if you hit the number you're looking for this way, then happy days. Eventually, though this approach gets you to a point where you can fit another track in the space and the resistance jumps up. If it's still below your target resistance, just keep going, but if it's now above your target resistance, then go back to the point just before you could fit in another track. From there, continue making the track narrower, but this time keep the track pitch constant, so whatever you subtract from the track width is added to the spacing between the tracks.

Questions about the code for computing the temperature come up semi-regularly and the best any of us have come up with is that maybe Chris developed his own formula based on some measurements because what's in the code doesn't correspond even remotely to what's on the LMT85 datasheet. Chris's design works, but barely. There are some better designs like the Spatz design, but it still suffers from some of the same hardware flaws as Chris's designs. It does have better attention to sensor setup, firmware and safety, though.","",""

I submitted designs to them last Friday and still waiting on one of them to be approved so I can pay and get them into manufacturing. The second design is really just a mechanical piece I designed to hold a heat spreader in place over the hotplate. They originally rejected it because there was no copper layer - I'm assuming they thought this was a mistake. When I confirmed that it wasn't and resubmitted it with a token copper layer (just contained text saying ""There is no copper"") they've now been going back and forther asking whether I want solder mask or no solder mask, silkscreen or no silkscreen, etc. I've told them it doesn't really matter either way. I'd like the top silkscreen layer. The solder mask is immaterial. Include it or don't, doesn't matter. Whatever's easiest. What's annoying me at this point is they haven't raised any issue for why it can't be manufactured as submitted, so why all the questions? Why not just manufacture what I submitted? In the meantime, I figured I'd also give Elecrow a go since I haven't tried their boards as hotplates yet. See how they compare to PCBWay and JLCPCB.

Apologies, a bit new to ordering a board presoldered / assembled (only just started ordering PCBs recently and this is my first having it be pre-assembled vs buying the components separately and soldering them). 

I managed to import the BOM and PNP.
I see:
Total  32 parts detected 27 Parts confirmed, 2 parts Inventory shortage, 3 parts not selected 

2 of the shortage appear to be just female headers which I have plenty so not worried there
The caps are just the ones mentioned as being not included to reduce costs right? So will source those separately.
Could you speak to what the SHORTING_LINK is? Will I need to just short that?

What else should I pick up?
- 4010 12v cooling fan
- 128x64 0.96"" OLED display
-  Rotary encoder module
- 1 1u diameter 3 capacitor
- 4 680uF diameter 10 capacitors
- 2 NTCs (any models you'd suggest here? not too familiar with these)

Then should be set aside from the need to 3D print the enclosure, program the microcontroller, and put it all together? Thanks for the assist and the neat project.","",""

Oled display
rotary encoder

Any ntc that can withstand the temperature. I use a rather expensive interchangeable ntc with curve fitting but steinhart approximation is supported too so you can use any ntc since it doesn't have to be very precise. 2nd slot is not used in the firmware atm.
You don't really need the fan either. If you want you can use it to cool the caps.","",""

You're a mod, so you can probably meet that requirement, then we can build a moderation and admin team here. The biggest challenge with moving to a new server is that the community is here and the traffic is being driven here. I suspect that most of that is from Great Scott's video, but maybe there's other places. We can still make Chris an admin and we can still transfer ownership if/when Chris comes back, but my position is that the community is here. Rather than try to move it somewhere else, we should try to manage the community that's already here and we can welcome Chris back if/when he wants to come back. Moving the server means also moving everything out there in the internet that drives traffic here or building something better that will more effectively drive traffic to the new location. That can be done and I was working on some of that, but personal circumstances are getting in the way of that again, so not sure how quickly I can get content out and even then there's the question of how effective I or others may be.","",""

They said that if a server is abandoned by the owner the ownership can be transferred, but you need to meet the following criteria:

1. The server is a public server.
2. It has at least 100 members.
3. The current owner has not accessed their account for at least a month.
4. The new server owner has moderator or admin permissions on the server.

We met every requirement except the last one. The request must be made by the new server owner. It can't be made on behalf of someone else. From the other information they provided, it also sounds like they also attempt to contact the existing owner before making the transfer because they also mentioned that they don't transfer ownership if the current owner declines the request. That sounds like they would also attempt to contact the server owner before making the transfer and would only do it after they either agree or don't answer within some time period, but I'm speculating. They didn't explicitly say that, only that the transfer could be declined by the current owner.

As for faster PWM, it all depends on what you're trying to achieve and whether the rest of the hardware is designed to take advantage of a higher frequency. The power design for the AfterEarthLtd versions and similar designs like Spatz aren't really designed well for high frequency, so running the PWM even faster isn't really going to help. I would expect it may make power losses in your caps worse, which means they will get hotter, which is bad.

Also, FR4 is not a single material with a single set of characteristics. There are numerous different resins that can be used as the bulk material in FR4 which can give varying degress of heat resistance. The same applies to the solder mask and silk screen materials. So expect to wear out your hotplates eventually - especially if you do silly things with them - but if you treat them well, they will last quite a few reflow cycles. I use JLCPCB for most of my boards, but I use PCBWay for hotplates. Their standard (ie. cheap) materials seem to be more resilient to thermal cycling and high temperatures than JLCPCB's standard materials - at least as of July this year.

Mine is an aluminium plate that sits on top of the FR4, but if you use an aluminium PCB you essentially have a heat spreader integrated into the hotplate. Once you have a decent heat spreader, thermal gradients aren't much of a problem any more, so you can measure the temperature anywhere and it's fairly representative of the whole hotplate.

Maybe if there's some particular component that's particularly heat sensitive, but at that point it'd likely be impossible to hand solder. Soldering irons generally run much hotter than any reflow device. Typical hand soldering might run the iron at somewhere north of 300 celsius to get good joints. Reflow profiles generally top out at somewhere around 250 for SAC alloys, maybe 220 for SnPb and much lower for SnBi.

That's how I've done most of my reflow in the past couple of years. I have a USB controllable power supply that can do up to 20A, so I can use that to both control the power and sense the temperature based on how the resistance of the heating element changes.","",""

Most thermal issues in 3D printing come down to mechanical issues, like using an enclosure, using the right solution for first layer adhesion and the like. I've no doubt that with a more elaborate sensor setup and tuning of the hardware and software you can produce much more accurate temperature readings, but at the end of the day, I only care whether my board is reflowed, that all the solder joints are electrically and mechanically sound and that I didn't overcook my hotplate, the board or any of my components. My reflow profiles for SnPb use a reflow temperature of 205 celsius which has worked quite well. Most commercial reflow profiles use reflow temperatures of around 225 celsius for SnPb and as high as 260 celsius for SAC alloys. I have a datasheet for a SMD LED that I just checked which suggested 230 celsius (SnPb) and 255 celsius (SAC) for reflowing their LEDs. If I can do +/-15 celsius, I could aim for 215, get somewhere within the 200-230 range for SnPb and still be confident of good joints everywhere and be well below the danger zone for damaging my SMD devices.","",""
