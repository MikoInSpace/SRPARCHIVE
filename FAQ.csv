In general, to achieve a given performance, you need a certain amount of power per unit area. There are challenges around accurate temperature sensing and issues around the board edges where you lose heat faster. I haven't done too much work on variability in the manufacturing process. The few boards I have used seem pretty close but I wouldn't say I've done any serious investigation on manufacturing precision yet. Spatz has some pretty good results in terms of process precision from JLCPCB - where I've gotten most of my boards from so far as well.

I haven't seen an FR4 material with a glass transition temperature below about 130 celsius. On the other hand for solder reflow, you're virtually guaranteed to be blowing past the glass transition temperature of virtually every FR4 material out there. Fortunately this doesn't seem to be a major problem so far - at least in my limited experience. I've thought about aluminium as an option, but I really don't think it's worth it. Disintegration of the base material isn't the problem with heat damage over time. What you really need to worry about is deterioration and delamination of the solder mask and while I haven't seen it yet, I also suspect that delamination of the copper from the base could be a problem depending on how different the coefficients of thermal expansion are. Aluminium's coefficient of thermal expansion is typically almost 40% higher than that of copper. PCBs aren't usually designed for the kind of thermal cycling we're doing here, so I'm not sure whether they'll be using some custom Si/Al alloy to try to match coefficients of thermal expansion that closely. I could be wrong, but given the warping that other people have noticed, I think that's a pretty good indication that they're using a more common Aluminium alloy that expands way more than we'd want.","",""

> Using ESP32 or alternatives to get round the ATmega328p shortages
#og-srp

Is there any update on this? This would be amazing. I am currently working on my own ESP32 reflow oven controller, and am hoping to implement some kind of central system to control and monitor a pnp and reflow oven. I imagine something like this:

when a placing job finished, the oven is automatically configured to use the correct profile (presumably the operator needs to select the type of paste used), maybe even the system would be able to adjust profiles as necessary by analysing the gerbers for large copper pours or whatnot. All the operator needs to do is take the panel from the pnp, throw it into the oven and hit a single 'go' button.

now, this doesn't make too much sense for this project as it currently is, simply because of the PCB reflow plate's size (or lack thereof), it cannot easily be used to reflow larger panels. but given a considerable upscaling (i do understand that comes with its own issues, but ignoring that for now) and addition of some sort of wireless control, this project has a lot of good potential.

I mention all of this simply because I would like to see some sort of 'standard' being developed for this communication with the reflow controller. If I could get anyone here onboard, and maybe the index / lumen pnp project, that would be quite good.","",""

Also, you can i.e. make one side with the PCB, but the over side in the oven, because the PCB won't work with one side full of components.

I know a few people who made such an oven, most have youtube videos online, you just need an Arduino, a display, a few buttons and some optical relais (the nice blue ones everyone uses) and you are good to go.","",""

There's not that much different between these hotplates and a heated bed PCB for a 3d printer, although a typical heated bed PCB like the Prusa design is quite a lot larger, so getting to reflow temperatures does increase the power requirements a bit. The one you've linked is even larger than the standard Prusa design. 120W only gets you to about 90 celsius on that bad boy. Given the area of that board, you'll probably want something closer to 300-400W to reflow low temperature solders. For tin-lead solder, you're looking at closer to 500W. A 24V 20A supply would probably do the trick if you happen to have something that beefy.

I think I could get one to about 180 celsius with only 65W, but it would take a while. That would be roughly the equilibrium temperature at 65W. So you wouldn't reflow SnPb. You could probably reflow SnBi, just really slowly. But that's on a 10x10cm hotplate. 15x15cm is over double the area, so I can't see you reaching reflow temperatures for even SnBi with only 65W. You're probably looking at closer to double that to reach reflow temperatures for SnBi alloys on a 15x15cm hotplate. If you want to follow something more like a typical reflow profile and complete the job in a reasonable amount of time, then you probably want to double that number again.

For most purposes, any of the commonly used alloys will work fine and you probably won't notice a difference. I personally prefer SnPb solder, because it's the alloy that we have the most experience with, it has good wetting characteristics, good mechanical properties and reasonably good conductivity. Also, if you get the eutectic alloy (63/37), it has a single, actual freezing point rather than a liquidus/solidus temperature range and this makes it easier to get good joints when hand soldering. I tend to avoid SAC alloys because of the higher temperature and the liquidus/solidus temperature range means that you end up with poor joints if there's much movement while it's freezing. I have some SnBi solder paste, but I rarely use it because the conductivity is lower, the joints are more brittle and if you use the cheapest finish on your boards (HASL with leaded solder) you risk forming SnBiPb intermetallics in the joint which may have liquidus temperatures below 100 celsius. That said, for most purposes you probably won't notice much difference and I'm probably overthinking it. (edited)","",""

I'd expect to see the magic smoke come out pretty quick with the kind of power supply needed to drive that hotplate. The input capacitance is known to be woefully low and the PWM frequency also woefully low for what it's intended to do, so there will be a lot of current going into and out of that capacitor every cycle, but with the default firmware it shouldn't need to dissipate more about a quarter of a watt. I did a worst case scenario simulation and estimated about 320mW dissipation in the input cap assuming an ESR of 0.1 ohm. I also pulled out my old v3.0 board and ran a reflow cycle. The input cap did warm up enough to feel the difference, but it was much. Measuring it, it went from about 23 celsius at the start (ie. ambient room temperature) to about 30 celsius by the end.

Ignoring that, could you create a hotplate that is larger than some existing design and change nothing other than the size of the hotplate? That depends. A larger hotplate requires more power to achieve the same thermal performance. I don't know which design you're starting from - perhaps the AfterEarthLtd v3.0 design for example. I also don't know just how much bigger you want to go. Frankly, the hardware design of the AfterEarthLtd design isn't great and has some serious flaws when it comes to the power design, so I'd be wary of trying to pull more power through it. If you're talking about a better design with more of a buck-derived power stage, that might be more amenable to higher power, but you'd need to look at the capabilities of the inductor and MOSFET in use to make sure that you're not going to saturate the inductor or overheat the MOSFET. For higher power, you may also want to consider a higher voltage. 12V is ok for smaller hotplates, up to maybe 100mm x 100mm or so, but the larger you go, the more current you need to get the required power and this becomes more and more difficult to do. 20-24V is probably worth considering if you want to go larger than that. If you want to go much larger, then you may want to consider even higher voltages. Up to about 48V or so, it's safe and generally easier to deal with a little more voltage than it is to deal with the higher currents you might need.","",""
