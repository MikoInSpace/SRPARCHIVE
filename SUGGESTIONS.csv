I think we should have some kind of democratic process for running things and that everyone who's a member on the server should get a vote in major changes - maybe that's just who the mods and admins are or maybe that could also include major policy stuff if that makes sense. To do that, I think we need some measure of membership, though. I would want to avoid the possibility that we could get brigaded and have someone effectively take over the server by having a mass of new users who've never been here all suddenly vote in the new team. Maybe it's as simple as anyone who's been a member for 3 months or more gets a vote, or maybe there's something more around how many posts or replies or something.
